		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Effective Date: August 1, 2014</p>
		<p>By using the GoPro website (GoPro.com) and/or any of GoPro’s online or mobile products, GoPro hardware or software, or other services (“Services”), including when you access the Services through game system platforms or mobile devices, you agree to GoPro’s Privacy Policy and that we may transfer and store your information in the United States.</p>
		<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. We will post any modifications or changes to the Privacy Policy on the GoPro website. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the GoPro website prior to the changes taking effect. Your continued use of the Services signifies your acceptance of our Privacy Policy as modified.</p>

	<h2>1. GoPro International Compliance</h2>
		<p>GoPro cares deeply about online privacy. GoPro complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. GoPro has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, GoPro commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. For all inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy, including European Union or Swiss citizens, should first contact GoPro by filling out our Support contact form here: "GoPro.com/support"/ GoPro has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by GoPro, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site for more information and to file a complaint: .BBB.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints</p>
	<h2>2. Information You Provide</h2>
		<p>GoPro collects both personal information and non-personal information that you provide to us, including personal information that may be contained in any video, comment, or other submission you upload or post to the Services. “Personal information” is information that identifies you and can be used alone to contact you online or offline. GoPro may collect Personal information from you in the context of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Account registration and administration of your user account;</li>
			<li>Contest registration and prize acceptance;</li>
			<li>Customer support and technical assistance;</li>
			<li>Processing your order for products or services offered by GoPro;</li>
			<li>Registration for your GoPro products;</li>
			<li>Providing updates to you regarding your GoPro products;</li>
			<li>Newsletter subscriptions;</li>
			<li>Access to GoPro products or services on social networks or third party services;</li>
			<li>Services provided online, by way of your mobile device or the GoPro software; and</li>
			<li>Other uses of the Services where Personal information is requested for use and/or participation.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The specific types of Personal information collected will depend upon the activity and may include your full name, email address, phone number, home address, mobile phone number, credit card information, and shipping address. Our mobile services may request access to your photos, wi-fi network name and product serial number. Those who win a prize in our contests may be required to provide their social security number and other identification for tax purposes, which will only be used for prize fulfillment purposes. GoPro may also ask for “non-Personal information,” i.e., information that, alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. Such non-Personal information may include, for example, gender, birth date, or zip code. You may be asked to submit non-Personal information with Personal information or separately.</p>
	<h2>3. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
		<p>When you use GoPro’s Services that connect to the internet, including when you access the Services via PC, mobile, and game system platforms, we may collect certain information as described in the sections below for such purposes as improvement of our products and software services, troubleshooting bugs, providing the services, managing the Services, tracking usage, providing content for referring traffic sources and improving overall performance of the Services. Such information may include IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, preferences, technical session information, browser type, information about your computer, hardware, software, or mobile device, including a device identifier, demographic information including gender, zip code and age, and navigational data including log files, server logs, clickstream data, and other data such as your location, where enabled, and language preference. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. If you arrived at our website via a link from another webpage, we may receive aggregate or otherwise anonymous statistical information about your visit to our site. We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site, and to improve the content of our website to better match the interests of our website users. We may combine this automatically collected and other non-Personal information with Personal information, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
		<p>GoPro uses cookies to store website visitors' preferences and to record session information, such as pages visited, interactions with website features, time spent on the website, shopping cart items, language preference, intended shipping region, and purchase behavior for various purposes such as ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, to tailor website content and newsletter communications according to visitor preferences, to serve online advertisements based on past visits to the website, and to inform and optimize website performance and online advertising campaigns. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal information you submit to us. GoPro allows third parties to collect non-Personal information by way of cookies, web beacons, and as described below from the GoPro website. GoPro does not enable third parties to collect any Personal information directly from the Services for their own promotional purposes. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GoPro and relevant ad serving, website feature, and analytics partners, and does not cover the use of cookies by 3rd party advertisers. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set -- each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You must, however, enable cookies from GoPro in order to use most functions on the website. We may also use flash cookies, also known as “local shared objects,” on our site. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cannot be removed or blocked via web browser settings. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (at http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/) and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel (athttp://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html).</p>
		<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
		<p>Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal information. One or more of our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called web beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.</p>
	<h3>Ad Servers, Third Party Advertising, and Website Analytics</h3>
		<p>We do not serve third party advertisements to you while using GoPro.com. However, we do work with website analytics and advertising partners, including Google, Doubleclick, AdRoll, Commission Junction and Facebook, to deliver GoPro advertisements on third party publisher websites - these partners may set cookies on your computer's web browser. These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you GoPro advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using GoPro.com. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, non-Personal information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to GoPro.com. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows GoPro to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, DoubleClick for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks. By doing so, we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our website after seeing our ads. For more information about these advertising services and how to opt out, please see the “Choice and Opt Out” section below.</p>
<h3>Camera Diagnostic Information</h3>
		<p>When you connect your GoPro camera to the Internet, we may automatically receive certain information about your camera and your use of the camera, including log files, camera modes, settings, durations, error rates, and other usage information. We collect and use this information solely in anonymous and aggregate form, unless you have provided your consent to associate this information with your camera serial number. This information helps us to improve our products and services, troubleshoot bugs, and analyze camera errors.</p>
<h3>Mobile Software Applications</h3>
		<p>When you use a GoPro mobile application we may automatically receive certain information about your mobile device and use of the application, including a device identifier, operating system, version, and other information about your mobile device as well as time spent in different portions of the GoPro mobile application. We monitor customer software usage to help us develop the design and layout of the mobile application and to improve the content to better match the interests of our users. We may also collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.</p>
